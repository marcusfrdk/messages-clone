<h1 align="center">Messages</h1>
This is an iOS Messages app clone I created in React Native. It should be quite simular to the real thing.

## FAQ
**Why did you create this?**<br/>
Mostly for fun, but also to learn more about React Native and what is possible. I will be adding features I think Apple should implement as well.

**How do I use this?**<br/>
It will be a close copy from the real thing. Meaning if you already know the app, it should be fairly intuitive.

**Can I contribute?**<br/>
Of course, feel free to add your own features to it, that would only be fun! Make a PR and I will add it.

**Can I use it for Android?**<br/>
It works, but is not optimized. It's neither created for the Android platform visually. Logically it works fine though.
